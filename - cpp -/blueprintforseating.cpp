//first, we want to compute the minimum inconvenience. 
//consider each aisle as having two 'sides' which consist of the seats that are closest to it. 
//in this way, the window seats are identical to the center group seats. 
//then, when we add a seat to a side of an aisle, the inconvenience will increase by exactly the amount of 
//seats that were originally there. 
//thus, we want to greedily add seats to aisles that have the minimum amount of seats. Using this method, we can
//pretty easily compute the minimum inconvenience. 

//now, different configurations with minimum inconvenience happen when n % (k * 2) != 0; we can't evenly distribute
//seats among the aisle groups. Thus, we have to count the number of ways to distribute the remaining seats among
//the aisle groups. 

//the issue is that we can't just do k * 2 choose r, where r is the number of remaining seats. This is because in 
//the middle sections, placing a seat on either group is indistinguishable. 

//'|' = aisle, 'O' = seat
//initial state: each group has 1 seat. 
// O|O O|O

//adding a seat to the 2nd group is indistinguishable to adding a seat to the third group.
// O|OO O|O vs. O|O OO|O

//so instead, we will first fix the amount of seats that get assigned to the window groups, and merge the middle
//groups. For each middle group, we can add 0, 1, or 2 extra seats. We can fix the amount of groups that get 2 extra
//seats, and from there the number of groups with 1 and 0 extra seats are fixed as well. Then, the number of sitations
//where 'a' groups get 2, 'b' groups get 1, and 'c' groups get 0 is nck(k - 1, a) * nck(k - 1 - a, b). 
//note that k - 1 is the total amount of middle groups. 

//in the case where n < 2 * k, we will not be able to add a seat to every aisle group, then we have a slightly 
//different but simpler way to compute the number of combinations. (left as an exercise to the reader)
