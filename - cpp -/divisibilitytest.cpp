//if at some point, b^k % n === 0, then we can use kind 1. 
//if at some point, b^k % n === 1, then we can use kind 2.
//if at some point, b^k % n === -1, then we can use kind 3.

//the justification for kind 1 is pretty obvious. 
//for kind 2, we notice that b^k * b^k or b^(2k) % n === 1 as well, same goes for any multiple of k. 
//for kind 3, whether or not it's positive or negative depends on the parity of k, thus it alternates. 

//we just find the earliest k at which any kind is satisfied. Note that we only have to iterate k at most
//n times, before the value of b^k % n becomes cyclic.
